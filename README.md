Data Structures and Algorithms Homework Repository!

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms Homework repository! This repository contains files for various homework assignments related to data structures, algorithms, and their implementation in C++ (or other relevant languages). Each assignment tackles different fundamental concepts and challenges, helping build a strong foundation in computer science.

Repository Structure

The repository is organized by assignment, with each folder containing the specific code, documentation, and resources related to that homework task. Hereâ€™s a general layout of the structure:

ðŸ“¦ Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
 â”£ ðŸ“‚ Assignment_1
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œ README.md
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œ main.cpp
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œ additional_file.h
 â”£ ðŸ“‚ Assignment_22
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œ README.md
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œ main.cpp
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œ additional_file.h
 â”— ...
Folder Contents
README.md: Describes the purpose of each assignment, key learning objectives, and any special instructions for running the code.
main.cpp and additional files (.h, .cpp): Code files implementing data structures and algorithms relevant to each assignment. Files may contain implementations of linked lists, trees, sorting algorithms, and more.
Requirements

These assignments were written in C++, so to compile and run the code, youâ€™ll need a C++ compiler, such as GCC or Clang. Any additional requirements are listed within the README file of each assignment.

Usage

To compile a program, navigate to the specific assignment directory and use the following commands:

g++ <filename>.cpp -o output_file
./output_file
Replace output_file with the desired name for the executable.
