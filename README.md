<h1>Data Structures and Algorithms Homework Repository</h1>

<p>Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms Homework repository! This repository contains files for various homework assignments related to data structures, algorithms, and their implementation in C++ (or other relevant languages). Each assignment tackles different fundamental concepts and challenges, helping build a strong foundation in computer science.</p>

<h2>Repository Structure</h2>

<p>The repository is organized by assignment, with each folder containing the specific code, documentation, and resources related to that homework task. Hereâ€™s a general layout of the structure:</p>

<pre>
ðŸ“¦ DSA_Homework
 â”£ ðŸ“‚ Assignment_1
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œ README.md
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œ main.cpp
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œ additional_file.h
 â”£ ðŸ“‚ Assignment_2
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œ README.md
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œ main.cpp
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œ additional_file.h
 â”— ...
</pre>

<h3>Folder Contents</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>README.md</strong>: Describes the purpose of each assignment, key learning objectives, and any special instructions for running the code.</li>
    <li><strong>main.cpp</strong> and <strong>additional files (.h, .cpp)</strong>: Code files implementing data structures and algorithms relevant to each assignment. Files may contain implementations of linked lists, trees, sorting algorithms, and more.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>These assignments were written in <strong>C++</strong>, so to compile and run the code, youâ€™ll need a C++ compiler, such as <strong>GCC</strong> or <strong>Clang</strong>. Any additional requirements are listed within the README file of each assignment.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>To compile a program, navigate to the specific assignment directory and use the following commands:</p>

<pre>
g++ main.cpp -o output_file
./output_file
</pre>

<p>Replace <code>output_file</code> with the desired name for the executable.</p>
